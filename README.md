# Wiggle

Minimal dependency manager for the Bend language. Currently supports local and
GitHub dependencies. Just add `#use {filename}` to any file that depends on
another, and it will concatenate all of your files into a single `out.bend`
with the correct ordering.

This is likely only going to be a toy project, but I would be happy for any
contributions!
